### Objective

PSI is a language for defining a program's behavior. It is designed to be both human and machine readable, while being able to translate seamlessly into other code, such as assembly or low-level op-codes.

### Comments

The `//` symbol marks the rest of the line as comment:

```psilang
// this is an comment
```

You can also make multi-line comments by writting `/*` at beginning and `*/` at end:

```psilang
/*
this is an multi line comment
*/
```
