### Objective

PSI is a language for defining a program's behavior. It is designed to be both human and machine readable, while being able to translate seamlessly into other code, such as assembly or low-level op-codes.

### Comments

The `//` symbol marks the rest of the line as comment:

```psilang
// this is an comment
```

You can also make multi-line comments by writting `/*` at beginning and `*/` at end:

```psilang
/*
this is an multi line comment
*/
```

### Program Structure

Every PSI Program should have the following structure:

```psilang
module program;
entry main;

main {

}
```
- `module` the program name
- `entry` the program entry label
- `main { ... }` definition of entry label

### Label Definitions

Each label can contain its own definitions. a definition is basically an block instructions:

```psilang
main {
    instruction1; 
    instruction2;
    instruction3;
    ...
}
```

### Types and Values

In PSI values can be represented in multiple ways

#### Integer
a value that represents a whole number. can be prefixed with `+` for positive values or `-` for nagtive values.
```psilang
13
-7
+1102
```
Non-integer values can also be expressed in hexadecimal, octal or binary:
```psilang
// hexadecimal with prefix 0x
0xDEADBEEF
0xdeadbeef

// octal with prefix 0o
0o01234567
0o755

// binary with prefix 0b
0b10010101
```

#### Float
a value that represents a floating-point value:
```psilang
0.7
3.14
130.99
```

#### Boolean
a value that can only be `true` or `false`.
